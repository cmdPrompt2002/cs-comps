===Description===


===Learning Goals===

  - Understand how to send multiple packets containing authentication information to a server
  - Understand how to do multithreading (long-term goal)
  - Understand ways to optimize password spraying

===Development goals===

  Implement a password spraying tool that supports the following options
    - formats the output nicely
    - Supported protocols: SSH, Basic HTTP authentication
    - Supports brute force and dictionary attacks
  
  As a stretch, we might try to implement the following options to our program:
    - multithreading
    - Cheking for valid command line arguments & other stuff
    - supports password spraying on multiple servers
    - generates a list of passwords based on statistics?
    - allows session restoration

===Rough Schedule===

Set up a server to attack, where access is granted through SSH logins - lots of accounts with different usernames and passwords.

Write our own program to spray passwords to this server.

Add options
  - formatting
  - delay
  - redirect output to file
  - error codes for invalid inputs

Reconfigure server to use Basic auth

Make our program compatible with Basic auth
